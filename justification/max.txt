The dataflow processing model is at the core of modern distributed data processing frameworks. In this talk, we will look into
3 systems (MillWheel, Ray, and Naiad) that utilise the aforementioned model. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the 
design choices (e.g., how the dataflow model is used, how the system approaches state) and their implications for different applications.
